                            Competitive Analysis of other company’s tone showed that most companies didn’t put much thought into their web presence. Those that did used stock photos which felt disingenuous to the actual patients they represented. From my analysis of the tone set by other companies, I was able to find a niche for Links HME's voice and tone.

                <p>
                    Through my competitive analysis of the voice and tone of other sites I determined which tonal niche was not currently being filled. I created a four point sliding scale with two opposing words to show where each company's tone lay relative to other companies. This made apparent where Links HME could distinguish itself from the competition.

                        To better illustrate how our voice and tone might be used in context, I created examples of how our voice might change in certain circumstances. The example messages take into consideration the primary person who the message will be speaking to, what they're thinking and feeling, and how our displayed message will address those concerns. This will better help our copywriter when writing for our site.
