                        <h1>Research</h1>
                        <p>Being new to the Home Medical Equipment (HME) industry, I knew it was critical to understand the needs of the stakeholders. I began interviewing key decision makers to understand what message our website needed to convey.
                        </p>

                        <p>It was difficult pulling key members from their duties, but after interviewing a customer service manager, a billing manager, a vice president, an HR manager, a trainer, and the IT administrator, I felt I had a solid foundation of information about the company.</p>

                        <h2>Research Findings</h2>

                        <p>After completing all interviews, it was time to compile the info. I created an affinity diagram by writing out my notes on sticky notes and grouping on a white board. Groups with greater numbers of sticky notes indicated themes that should be addressed on the website. </p>

                    Once the key themes were determined, I was able to create 3 distinct personas. These personas were the main parties who would ultimately determine what software would manage their shipments to customers, billing of customer insurance, and inventory.
